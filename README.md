Rover Punch is a short action game about a rover sent by Earth to terraform Mars. Armed with only a cactuc needle shooter, the rover is sent by itself into a hostile territory and asked to plant 4 saplings. Upon completion of this task, the rover shuts down and another rover is sent to continue the mission.
